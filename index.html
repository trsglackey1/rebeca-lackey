Steller track record in mentoring team members to enhance efficiency, streamlining processes to minimize wastage, and delivering exceptional client service.

Confident, detail-oriented, well-organized, and a great team player. Ability to work independently with minimal oversight and manage multiple projects simultaneously.</p>
          <p>I am married for 22 years and have two almost grown children. In my free time, I like to be outside. I enjoy camping and hiking. The best place that I have camped and hiked is <a href="https://thehockinghills.org/"target="_blank">Hocking Hills, Ohio</a>. I recommend that to everyone. Bring your hiking shoes! There are some great caves to see. Traveling is something that I do as often as I can. Going to places I have never been is really exciting to me. Most recently, my family spent a week in New York City and before that a week in the Bahamas.</p>
          <p>Volunteering is another activity I enjoy. Currently, I am the president of the <a href="https://stockbridgeathletics.com/main/boosters"target="_blank">Stockbridge Athletic Boosters</a>. We raise and distribute funds to enhance the level of support of the athletic program beyond the capabilities of the athletic budget. Our mission is to bring together parents and community members dedicated to encouraging and supporting the athletes and athletic programs in the Stockbridge Community School District by assisting in fundraising events to support the programs, promoting the positive benefits of athletic participation, and celebrating the athletic achievements. Also, I volunteer at the <a href="https://www.waterloofarmmuseum.org/"target="_blank">Waterloo Farm Museum</a> at their annual events in different capacities.</p>
