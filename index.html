         <p>I’ve been happily married for 22 years and am the proud parent of two almost-grown children. Family is at the center of my life, but I also love spending my free time outdoors. Camping and hiking are my favorite ways to connect with nature, and one of the best places I’ve explored is <a href="https://thehockinghills.org/"target="_blank">Hocking Hills, Ohio</a>. The trails there are amazing, and the caves are unforgettable—make sure to bring your hiking shoes!</p>
         <p>Traveling is another passion of mine. I get a thrill from visiting places I’ve never been and immersing myself in new experiences. Most recently, my family spent a week in New York City, exploring the city’s vibrant streets and iconic landmarks. Before that, we enjoyed a relaxing week in the Bahamas, soaking up the sun and the ocean. Each trip is an opportunity to make memories and discover something new.</p>
         <p>Whether it’s exploring the great outdoors or venturing to new destinations, I love making the most of every adventure life offers.</p>
